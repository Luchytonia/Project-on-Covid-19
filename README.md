# Project on Covid 19 
## Introduction
This is a project on covid 19 cases among different continents. In this python project, we will be evaluating dataset from different region(continents) to determine the rate/effect of covid 19. We will be looking out for 5 most affected regions. we will also check the death rate by age group and how it varies across different continents. basically checking the total cases reported, total deaths, and if covid 19 has any effect on birth rate and its effect across different continents. The dataset we will be using for this project is a .csv file and the data is from 2020 to 2022.
## Data Assessment
After importing our data, we changed out date datatype to datetime, we had missing values in some columns which was fixed, then outliers were corrected. this is is to help us have a clean dataset for our analysis. our dataset doesnt have any duplicates.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Here we analysed our dataset, then asked some questions which helped us to uncover meaningful insights.
